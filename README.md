Project Description:

The purpose of this project is to clean up a dataset. Along the process, I try to get some insights and draw some conclusions.

The following steps are taken:
- loading and inspecting the dataset
- dropping irrelevant columns
- handling stringified JSON columns
- flattening nested columns
- cleaning numerical, dateTime, text, and string columns
- removing duplicates
- saving the cleaned dataset in a csv-file
